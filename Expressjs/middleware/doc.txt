What is Middleware?
Middleware is code that runs between the request and response in a web application. It processes the request before it reaches the endpoint (route handler) and/or processes the response before itâ€™s sent back to the client.

Think of Middleware as:
A series of gates or filters a request must pass through before reaching the final destination.

ðŸ“Œ Common Uses of Middleware:
Authentication â€“ Check if a user is logged in.

Logging â€“ Log details of each request.

Validation â€“ Validate data in requests.

Error Handling â€“ Catch and handle errors.

CORS â€“ Enable cross-origin resource sharing.

Request Modification â€“ Add headers, parse JSON/body, etc.

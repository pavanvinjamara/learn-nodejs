What is Middleware?
Middleware is code that runs between the request and response in a web application. It processes the request before it reaches the endpoint (route handler) and/or processes the response before itâ€™s sent back to the client.

Middleware can be present one or more between request and response.

Think of Middleware as:
A series of gates or filters a request must pass through before reaching the final destination.

ðŸ“Œ Common Uses of Middleware:
Authentication â€“ Check if a user is logged in.

Logging â€“ Log details of each request.

Validation â€“ Validate data in requests.

Error Handling â€“ Catch and handle errors.

CORS â€“ Enable cross-origin resource sharing.

Request Modification â€“ Add headers, parse JSON/body, etc.
****************** Routes **************************

To implement Middleware we need the routes also

In Expressjs, Routes are like that tell your web application how to respond to different Http Request, URLs or endpoints.

Routes are used to define what happens when a user visits a specificURL on our website or makes a request to your API.

Routes help us to organize our application's functionality and determine what content or data should be sent back to the user in response to their request.

In Express.js, a route defines how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a combination of a path and an HTTP method (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Routes

In Express.js, a route defines how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a combination of a path and an HTTP method (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Basic Route Syntax
    app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

==> app: The instance of Express.

==> METHOD: The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

==> PATH: The endpoint (e.g., "/users").

==> HANDLER: The function that executes when the route is matched.

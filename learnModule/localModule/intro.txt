// A local module in Node.js is a custom JavaScript module that you create yourself in your application, as opposed to built-in (like fs, http) or third-party modules (like express).

// Local modules are files or sets of files that encapsulate reusable logic, functions, objects, or classes â€” and are imported using require() (CommonJS) or import (ES Module syntax).


// ðŸ”¹ Why Use Local Modules?
// Modularity: Keep code organized and separated into small files.

// Reusability: Functions and logic can be reused in multiple places.

// Maintainability: Easier to read, debug, and manage code.

// Encapsulation: Keeps private logic hidden, only exposes what's needed.

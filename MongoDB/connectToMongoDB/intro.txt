Connecting with mongoDB using nodejs & ExpressJs

what is Database ?

A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it like a digital filing system that stores information in a structured way.

ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
Data: Can be anythingâ€”names, numbers, images, videos, documents.

Organized: Stored in tables, rows, columns (in relational databases), or collections and documents (in NoSQL databases).

Accessed: Through software like Database Management Systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.

ðŸ’¡ Example:
Letâ€™s say you run an online store. Your database might have:

A table for users (name, email, password)

A table for products (name, price, quantity)

A table for orders (user ID, product ID, date)

ðŸ§  Types of Databases:
Relational Database (SQL): Data is stored in tables (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

NoSQL Database: Flexible data models (MongoDB, CouchDB)

In-Memory Database: Super-fast access (Redis)

Cloud Database: Hosted online (Firebase, AWS RDS)

******************************* Class**********

There are so many databases but we mostly use development databases are two types 

* relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
* NoSQL Database

SQL means structured Query Language means structured data
NoSQL means Binary JSON Format it is also called BSON Format un structured Data
BSON Format is similar to plain JSON Format or text document format
This BSON format is used mongoDB for data storage and data interchange purposes. 

************ MongoDB***** 
def: MongoDB is a popular open-source. NoSQL database Management system(DBMS) that is designed for handling large amounts of unstructred or semi-structured data.
MongoDB is often used for applications that require flexible, scalable, and high-performance data storage and retrieval

we are using mongoDB Atlas
